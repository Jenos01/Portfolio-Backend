# Portfolio Backend – Spring Boot

Backend service for a personal portfolio platform.
Provides REST APIs for project management, authentication, and user interactions.

🚧 **Status: Work in Progress**

This backend is actively under development.  
Some features (notably Spring Security refinements) are still being improved.

---

## Overview

The backend powers a portfolio website with:  
- An [**Admin Dashboard**](https://github.com/Jenos01/Portfolio-Admin-Dashboard) for managing projects, skills, and certifications  
- A [**Public Interface**](https://github.com/your-username/public-interface-repo) where users can view content  
- User authentication allowing registered users to comment on and rate projects

The backend is designed as a RESTful API consumed by separate frontend applications.
